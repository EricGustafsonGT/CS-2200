Linux
    1. Download CircuitSim1.8.2.jar (leave it compressed) and javafx. Make sure you are using java 11. I used Ubuntu 18.04, and I just did
    sudo apt install default-jdk, and then
    sudo apt install openjfx
        *I believe that javafx doesn't come with the default-jdk install (maybe it does, I didn't spend much time looking at it). 
    
    2. Then, in the directory containing the CircuitSim1.8.2.jar, run the command
    java -jar --module-path /usr/share/openjfx/lib --add-modules=javafx.base,javafx.controls,javafx.fxml CircuitSim1.8.2.jar

    3. Then, CircuitSim should just open up.
