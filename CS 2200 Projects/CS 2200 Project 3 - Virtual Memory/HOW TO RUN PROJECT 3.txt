Use the provided makefile for this project. Everytime you see "make" in the instructions below just run the makefile
configuration (currently called "Project 3 Configuration")




1.) To run the project with any replacement algorithm, use any of the following:

make
./vm-sim -i traces/<NAME OF TRACE>.trace -<NAME OF ALGORITHM>

for example,
./vm-sim -i traces/simple.trace -rrandom
./vm-sim -i traces/simple.trace -rclocksweep
./vm-sim -i traces/perlbench.trace -rfifo




2.) "One challenge of working with any memory-management system is that your system can easily corrupt its
    own data structures if it misbehaves! Such corruption issues can easily hide until many cycles later, when
    they manifest as seemingly unrelated crashes later.

    To help with detecting these issues, we’ve included a “corruption check” mode that aggressively verifies your
    data structures after every cycle. To use the corruption checker, run the simulator with the -c argument:"

./vm-sim -c -i traces/<NAME OF TRACE>.trace -r<NAME OF ALGORITHM>

for example,
./vm-sim -c -i traces/simple.trace -rrandom
